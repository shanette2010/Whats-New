# What's-New

In the pass couple of day's there were many things we touched on over in class.
From stings, boolean's, number's, variables, operator's and Template literal's.
Im starting to get the hang of what the meanings are and how to use them properly.
Im still a little confused on how to use template literals. But im understanding how to use booleans a bit more. 
Since you can use them with operators and logical operators. Its making more sense when im able to put in into a formate.


**_Strings_**
  1. You have backticks (` `)
  2. You have double quotes (" ")
  3. You also have forward ticks (' ')
While using code we normally stick to double quotes but these are all the ways you can use a sting!


**_Unary Operators and Logical Operators_**
  1. console.log(typeof) //number
     * unary minus (-)  often used for the vaule of a numeric expression.
     * example: x=5/ y=-x (y will be -5)
  2. true && false = false/ true && true = true
     *! means **NOT**
     * == means **EQUAL**
     * example: `let` istrue = true; `let` isfalse = !istrue; //false will be false
    
**Booleans and number's**
  1. Both do not contiain ""
  2. booleans are always true or false statments.

**Operator's**
To create a vaule, you must invoke(referance) its name. 

const firstName = "Shanette";
const lastName = "Whitehead";

const fullName = firstName + " " + lastName; // "Shanette Whitehead"
